## TikTok  
*(No specific TikTok URLs found in initial search; you may need to gather them manually.)*

---

## Notes  
- These URLs were pulled from publicly available posts as of now.  
- For completeness, check TikTok and Instagram stories/highlights for more before/after content.  
- You might want to create a CSV or spreadsheet later with additional metadata (date, platform, service type, views).  
- If you want **all** posts, a manual audit may still be needed (scrolling your account history, filtering by hashtags like `#beforeandafter`, `#restoration`, `#goodyearwelt`).  
- After compilation, this `.md` file can be added to your content repository for reference or used in your Shopify/WordPress site.

---

**Would you like me to**:  
- Search for **more** (complete list) including TikTok and create a full export?  
- Generate a CSV or spreadsheet version?  
- Add a section to your site at chezgerry1958.com linking these with thumbnails and descriptions?  

Let me know how you’d like to proceed!
